### Academic Projects

[HashTable](https://github.com/samuelajackson/hashTable)
Using an array-based implementation, this project fulfills the HashTable ADT. Users
can set the input type as well as the load factor and the program will sort the given
data into hash tables using both linear hashing and double hashing. Results are printed
into the console that displays the average number of probes per element, as well as the
number of duplicates in the data.

[Java/MySQL Database Management](https://github.com/samuelajackson/CS-HU310Final)
This project was a collaborative project between myself and another student, Terran
Dykes. Here, a database that was created in MySQL is managed via Java code. This
depository holds said Java code, which parses user inputted information to edit the
database.
