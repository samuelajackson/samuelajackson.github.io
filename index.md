## Welcome to Samuel Jackson's github page!
This is where I am displaying academic projects.

### Education

I am currently studying at Boise State University. Relevant coursework includes:

- CS121 - 321
- CS253
- ECE330
- Various hatchery units

Current GPA: 3.8

### Employment

I am always on the lookout for opportunities. I am especially interested in positions
related to computer science that will allow me to use the knowledge I've acquired
practically.

### Academic Projects

[HashTable](https://github.com/samuelajackson/hashTable)
Using an array-based implementation, this project fulfills the HashTable ADT. Users
can set the input type as well as the load factor and the program will sort the given
data into hash tables using both linear hashing and double hashing. Results are printed
into the console that displays the average number of probes per element, as well as the
number of duplicates in the data.

[Java/MySQL Database Management](https://github.com/samuelajackson/CS-HU310Final)
This project was a collaborative project between myself and another student, Terran
Dykes. Here, a database that was created in MySQL is managed via Java code. This
depository holds said Java code, which parses user inputted information to edit the
database.

**SMASH Shell** Using C, I created a shell that can be launched from the BASH shell itself. This
project involved the use of structs to store information like the history command; furthermore, both
Fork and Pipe were used to divert unknown commands to the BASH shell, allowing for increased
functionality.

**ReaderOfBooks GUI** My first major programming project, this Java based GUI allows the user to
add a list of text files into a reader and select them, opening their contents. This program uses JButtons
and action listeners in a dynamic way and demonstrates an understanding of graphic display management.
